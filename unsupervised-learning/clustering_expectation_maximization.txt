Clustering and Expectation Maximization

supervised learning: function approximation
unsupervised learning: Data description

Single Linkage Clustering
  consider each object a cluster
  define inter-cluster distance as the distance between the closest two points
  merge two closest clusters
  repeat

k-means clustering
  pick k centers (1st random)
  each center claimss its closest points
  recompute the centers
  repeat until center does not move

Soft Clustering
  idea instead hard seperate the point to two different cluster, you can give the presentage

Clustering Properties
  Richness: can generate the different number of clusters
  Scale-ivariance: if change the distance scalint the cluster dosenot chanage
  consistency:
