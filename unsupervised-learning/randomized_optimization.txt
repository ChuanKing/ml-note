Optimization Approaches:
  generate and test: the input space is finit and small. Also the function is complex like mod
  calculus: the function has to have derivative and can be solved as zero
  newton's method: has the derivative and can be iteratively improve, the function is single optimum
  if all above method does not work ---> Randomized Optimization

Hill Climbing:
  idea: find a point and find the maxium of x-1, x, x+1
  hill climbing can be stuck in the local optimization

Randomized Hill Climbing
  repeat hill climbing, after find the local maxium and randomly chose another point and repeat

Simulated Annealing
  don't always improve -- sometime you need to search
               exploit                         explore
  algorith:
    1. sample new point xt in N(x)
    2. jump to that point probability P(x, xt, T)
    3. decrease the temperature
    P(x, xt, T) = ---> 1. if f(xt) >= f(x)
                  \--> e exp((f(xt) - f(x)) / T)
    if the xt is far from x, that is not likely to move
    T -> 0: like hill climbing
    T -> infinity: random walk
    Pr(ending at maxium) = (e exp(f(x) / T)) / Zt  

Genetic Algorithms
  Population of individuals
  Muation local search
  Crossover
  generations

MIMIC
  generate samples from P(x) of 𝛉t
  set 𝛉t+1 to nth percentice
  retain only these samples f(x)>= 𝛉t+1
  estimate P(x) of 𝛉t+!
  go to step 1
