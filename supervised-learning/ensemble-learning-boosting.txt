ensemble learning
  building up bunch of rules and combining them together until you got something that is good

ensemble learning algorithm
  learn over a subset of data and generate a rule
  repeate previous step
  combine all of the rules

bagging
  take a random subset and combine by the mean

Boosting
  take the hardest question(make the hardest question high rate)
  weight vote

weak learner
  no matter what the distribution is over your data, will do better than chance
  better than the change(all the learning set error rate is less 0.5)

D
  is used to give the hard question a high weight
