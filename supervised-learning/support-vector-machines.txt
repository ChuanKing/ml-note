Support Vector Machines:

idea: find a line can seperate two groups, and there is only some of the points that is really matter
Margin: the max distance between two different hyperplane
the best way to find the margin is quadratic program
support vector: is the point that can have more effect on the margin
when the current dimension is not enough we can project it into higher dimension
kernel trick: is the domain knowledge, which is used to project to higher dimension
