Bayesian Learning:
Basic Idea: use the Bayes rule to find out which hypothesis is better
Bayes Rule: Pr(h|D) = Pr(D|h) * Pr(h) / Pr(D)
  Pr(h|D): probability of hypothesis of give data
  Pr(D|h): probability of give data that use the hypothesis
  Pr(h): probability of the hypothesis this is the domain knowledge
  Pr(D): probability of the data
  The idea of using this Bayes Rule is to calculate Pr(h|D) is very hard but calculate the Pr(D|h) is easier
  priors matter
Maximum a posteriori: assume prior is uniform
  hmap = argmax Pr(D|h) * P(h)
Maximum lielihood hypothesis
  hml = argmin SUM (di - h(xi))2
Minimum decriation:
  hmap = argmax Pr(D|h) * P(h)
       = argmin[-lg P(D|h) - lg P(h)] 
  -lg P(D|h): error
  -lg P(h): the number of the hypothesis
  Idea the best hypothesis is the one that minimize error and the size of your hypothesis

*** Vmap = argmax SUM P(v|h) P(h|D)
