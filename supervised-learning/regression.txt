regression
  definiation:
    continuous value function(maping the space to some real
    output is continuous

regression:
  use the function to approximate the result

linear regression:
  minimize the deviation between the line and the number
  the best way to find the line is using calculus

order of polynomial:
  Polynomial expansion
  the hight order can fit the data well, however it can create craziness

error:
  you have put the error into the consideration
  sensor error
  maliciously
  transcription error
  unmodeled influences

cross validation
  the data should be IID(independent and identically distributed)
  take some training data as test data and cacluate the error
  do the pre step serveral time
  it is important to find polynomial order

other input
  vector input increase dimension
  Discrete input: encode the input but make sure the order
