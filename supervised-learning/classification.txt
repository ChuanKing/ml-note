  definiation:
    map the input to some label
    output is discrete set
  key word:
    Instances: input
    concept: funciton, map input to output
    target concept: result, answer
    hypothesis: all possible function
    sample: training set
    candidate: concept will be target concept
    testing set: use the condidate set to test
    important!!! training set should not be the testing set
  decision tree
    1. find out the criteria
    2. tree parts:
      a. node - decision node, you take a attribute and ask question
      b. edges of the tree - value
      c. leaf node - answer
    3. should always go from top of the tree
    4. the decision tree should from general to detail
    5. how to make tree:
      a. pick best attribute (attribute can splite the data set to equal two parts)
      b. ask question
      c. follow the anser of the path
      d. go to a until you get the answer
    6. expressiveness
      a. A and B
      b. A or B
      c. A xor B (they cannot both to be true)
      d. n-or: any (this will be a linear growth)
      e. n-xor: parity (this will be exponential growth)
    7. ID3:
      a. pick the best attribute
      b. assign A as decision attribute for the node
      c. for each value of A create a descendant of node
      d. sort the training examples to leaves
      e. to a
    8. best attribute:
      a. information gain
      b. Gain(S, A) = Entropy(S) - SUM (|Sv| / |S|) Entropy(Sv)
    9. bias:
      a. restriction bias: when do the decisioin, all of the decision has same possibility
      b. preference bias: some router have more possibility than the other
      c. good split at top
      d. correct over incorrect
      c. prefer shorter tree
    10. other considerations
      a. continuous attributes: continue to discrete. or look the training set
      b. when do we stop?: everything is classified correctly
      c. regression

regression
  definiation:
    continuous value function(maping the space to some real number)
    output is continuous
