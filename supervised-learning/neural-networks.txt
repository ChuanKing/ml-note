artificial neural networks:
  there are several input x1, x2, x3 with weight w1, w2, w3
  if the sum of xn * wn > threshold, then output is 1, otherwise the output is 0

neural network for ML is find out the wn and threshold

perception rule
  set the weight for single unit to match the training set
  wi = wi + ∆wi
  ∆wi = n (y - ∆y) xi
  ∆y = (∑ wi xi ≥ 0)
  y is the target
  ∆y is the output
  n is the learning rate
  x input
  the perception rule will find the linearly separation

gradient descent
  for non-linearly separablity
  ∆wi = n (y - a) xi
