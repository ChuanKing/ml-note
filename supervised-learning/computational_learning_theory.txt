Computational Learning Theory

idea: to see which learning algorithm is good
how to compare: 
  1. what is the problem you want to learn
  2. to see if the specifi algorithms work or not
  3. or the problem cannot be solved
how can define which algorithm is good or not:
  1. time
  2. space
  3. the data: the fewer data used the better algorithm is
More detail about which learning is good:
  1. successful rate
  2. the numbers of the data should be use
  3. the complexity of hypothesis
    good: can solve the complex problem
    bad: easily overfit
  4. accuracy to which target concept is approximated
  5. manner in which training examples presented
    method: batch and online
  6. manner in which training examples selected
The way the examples be seleceted:
  1. learner ask teacher
  2. teacher give learner
  3. nature 
  4. Evil 
PAC learning
  Probably approximately correct learning
Epsilon Exhausted
  all the hypothesis is less than this number
Haussler Theorem
  m >= 1/e * (ln |H| + ln 1/d)
